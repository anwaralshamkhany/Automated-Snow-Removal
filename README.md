# Automated-Snow-Removal
The purpose of this project is to create a completly automated rover that can clean snow similar to how a hand plow works. The rover can either be remote controlled from afar or it will use machine learning for an adpative path that ensures all the snow has been cleaned. The project is by no means desgined to carry a large amount of snow.
